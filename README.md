# File-Manger-using-python

This is an AI-powered file management application built using Python and Tkinter. Designed for enhanced organization, 
this app allows users to manage files and directories effectively. It integrates basic AI features, including voice 
command functionality, file categorization by type, and quick access to recently modified files, all of which make file management more intuitive.

## Features

- **File and Directory Management**: 
  - Browse and change directories
  - Open, delete, create files and folders
  
- **AI Features**:
  - **Voice Commands**: Execute commands like "open file", "delete file", and "search file" via voice input. (To use the voice command feature, first
    click the 'Voice Command' button. The application will display 'Listening.' Then, tap OK and speak your command (e.g., 'open file,' 'delete file,' or 'search file').
    After processing, the application will display what it heard. Once you review and confirm by clicking OK, it will execute the specified action).
  - **File Categorization**: Automatically sort files by type (Documents, Images, Videos, Audio).
  - **Recent Files Suggestion**: Display the five most recently modified files in the current directory.
